===========May 31st 2022===========
Today was pretty good I went out on
that walk like I said yesterday. I
managed to resist the urge to self
harm so hopefully I can keep that up.
I also went to pickup a perscription
for my dad, I was very tempted to ask
the chemist about hormone blockers but
I got too scared to an didn't. I think
I'm going to relax tommorrow. :)

===========May 30th 2022===========
Today was a bad day, not necessarily
because of anything that happened, but
rather, my mood was pretty bad and
unfortunatly, I did self harm quite a
few times today. I never done anything
other than just lay around all day. I
think I'm going to go out on a walk
tomorrow
